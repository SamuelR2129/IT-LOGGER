# IT-LOGGER

An IT-Logger application where you can:

- Add logs and give them a priority flag
- Delete logs and techs
- Create technicians and assign them to logs
- Edit logs
- Search for logs and techs

I use React for the functionality, I use Materialize for the styling, I use Redux for the state management and have a local database.
